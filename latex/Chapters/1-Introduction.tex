\section{Context}

\Gls{ml} is becoming increasingly applied to the control of safety-critical systems, where failures lead to unintended and potentially harmful behaviour~\citep{amodei}.
Examples of these systems include autonomous automotive systems, traffic control systems, medical devices, aviation software, industrial robotics, and many more cyber-physical systems that interact with our environment.
Many of these systems have so far only existed as proof of concepts, but are steadily approaching commercial use within our society.
Consequently, the safety of \gls{ml} for the use of controlling safety critical systems has become a focused area of research in recent years.

The issue regarding \gls{ml} within safety-critical systems stems from the typically stochastic nature of their algorithms, which
leads to a lower degree of understanding than software that is explicitly programmed to perform a specific task~\citep{pereira}.

Section about different programming languages for ml



\section{Motivation}


need for a ml testing within a wider range of programming languagegs

generic bindings to z3 etc.
