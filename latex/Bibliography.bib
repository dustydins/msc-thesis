ABSTRACT = {Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly applied for the control of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in application areas that cannot easily be mastered with traditional control approaches, such as autonomous driving. As a consequence, the safety of machine learning became a focus area for research in recent years. Despite very considerable advances in selected areas related to machine learning safety, shortcomings were identified on holistic approaches that take an end-to-end view on the risks associated to the engineering of ML-based control systems and their certification. Applying a classic technique of safety engineering, our paper provides a comprehensive and methodological analysis of the safety hazards that could be introduced along the ML lifecycle, and could compromise the safe operation of ML-based CPS. Identified hazards are illustrated and explained using a real-world application scenario&mdash;an autonomous shop-floor transportation vehicle. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is intended as a basis for future holistic approaches for safety engineering of ML-based CPS in safety-critical applications, and aims to support the focus on research onto safety hazards that are not yet adequately addressed.},

AB  - We present MCMAS, a model checker for the verification of multi-agent systems. MCMAS supports efficient symbolic techniques for the verification of multi-agent systems against specifications representing temporal, epistemic and strategic properties. We present the underlying semantics of the specification language supported and the algorithms implemented in MCMAS, including its fairness and counterexample generation features. We provide a detailed description of the implementation. We illustrate its use by discussing a number of examples and evaluate its performance by comparing it against other model checkers for multi-agent systems on a common case study.

abstract = {We study the problem of verifying role-based multi-agent systems, where the number of components cannot be determined at design time. We give a semantics that captures parameterised, generic multi-agent systems and identify three notable classes that represent different ways in which the agents may interact among themselves and with the environment. While the verification problem is undecidable in general we put forward cutoff procedures for the classes identified. The methodology is based on the existence of a notion of simulation between the templates for the agents and the template for the environment in the system. We show that the cutoff identification procedures as well as the general algorithms that we propose are sound; for one class we show the decidability of the verification problem and present a complete cutoff procedure. We report experimental results obtained on MCMAS-P, a novel model checker implementing the parameterised model checking methodologies here devised.},

In this paper we discuss a variant sigmoid function with three parameters that denote the dynamic range, symmetry and slope of the function respectively. We illustrate how these parameters influence the speed of backpropagation learning and introduce a hybrid sigmoidal network with different parameter configuration in different layers. By regulating and modifying the sigmoid function parameter configuration in different layers the error signal problem, oscillation problem and asymmetrical input problem can be reduced. To compare the learning capabilities and the learning rate of the hybrid sigmoidal networks with the conventional networks we have tested the two-spirals benchmark that is known to be a very difficult task for backpropagation and their relatives.",
