\section{Context}

\Gls{ml} is becoming increasingly applied to the control of safety-critical systems, where the failure of such systems could be hazardous to human life, property, or the environment.
Examples of these systems include autonomous automotive systems, traffic control systems, medical devices, aviation software, industrial robotics, and many more cyber-physical systems that interact with our environment.
Many of these systems have so far only existed as proof of concepts, but are steadily approaching commercial use within our society.
Consequently, the safety of \gls{ml} for the use of controlling safety critical systems has become a focused area of research in recent years.
